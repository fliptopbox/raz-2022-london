    style="background-image:url(/images/people-on-the-floor.jpg)">About this training</h2>

  <section class="columns">
    <div class="col">
      <p>Both voluntary and involuntary, breathing constitutes the most fundamental and primary movement of life. The
        action of breathing is an integrated part of every single action that we take, and is affected by how we act,
        what
        we think, our motivations, intentions and emotional state.</p>

      <p>As practitioners, how much attention do we pay to our student's breathing habits?</p>

      <p>Are they obvious or elusive to us, and should they be explicitly or implicitly addressed?</p>

      <p>In this advanced training Raz will illuminate the deep connections between our breathing patterns, our
        self-carriage and our sense of well-being and how interacting with our own and our student's breathing patterns
        potentiates profound change and improvement.</p>

      <p>Raz will begin with a thorough examination of the physio-motor characteristics of breathing, clarifying how the
        optimal, non-disturbed breathing mechanism works. Understanding the different synergies that are involved in
        producing the continuous flow of air is essential for understanding how breathing and upright carriage are
        intimately linked and form one single system.</p>

      <p>Raz will then guide us in a detailed exploration of the different common breathing disturbances and how they
        are
        linked to common faulty postural patterns, further clarifying how a well-organized breathing mechanism aids in
        upright carriage and vice versa.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      <p>After exploring in theory and in practice through Awareness through Movement lessons, we will examine how to
        apply these synergistic relationships in Functional Integration. Sensitizing ourselves to join and follow our
        student’s breathing, relating the breathing to the organization of the spine, using our hands to stimulate and
        expand the breathing pattern are all skills that we will explore together. </p>
      <p>You will gain a better understanding of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The workings of the ideal breathing mechanism. </li>
        <li>The most common breathing disturbances. </li>
        <li>How breathing and uprightness are synergistic. </li>
        <li>Incorporating breathing in Awareness through movement lessons. </li>
        <li>Approaching breathing patterns in Functional Integration lessons. </li>
        <li>The central role of breathing in the integration of a lesson.</li>
      </ul>

        Post training:

      <p>Included in the price is free access to FI videos, ATM recordings and a Zoom Q&A with Raz.</p>

      <h3>Question time follow-up video:</h3>
      <p>A recorded Q&A session will be recorded to address any questions that you may have afterward. Questions can be submitted via email.</p>
