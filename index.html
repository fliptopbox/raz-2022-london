<h3>About this training:</h3>

In this workshop we will analyze how the hip-joints serve as the
“launching pad” for efficient walking and upright carriage and hone
our observational skills.

We want to recognize in the student their self-organization and gait
patterns. The ability to observe those is essential for Functional
Integration teachers to access the potential for long-lasting change.

We will enrich our understanding by examining the functional anatomy
of the hip joints, by analyzing videos of walking, running and athletic
performances.

Each day will be accompanied by an Awareness Through Movement lesson
that is specifically chosen to highlight the functional relationships
that will be explored in Functional Integration.

The functionality of our hip joints is a marvel!

On the one hand, they enable freedom in all three dimensions of movement.
And on the other hand, they “carry” the task of supporting the body in
non-stable conditions.

These supposedly opposing properties, mobility and stability, are in
fact synergistic and serve upright organization gracefully.

            <div>
<h3>Afterwards you will be able to:</h3>
<li>Recognise how the hip joints work in unison to create efficient support and mobility.</li>
<li>Apply some functional anatomy of the hip-pelvic girdle relating to walking. </li>
<li>Identify some functional insights from an evolutionary perspective.</li>
<li>Observe and engage with your students’ gait pattern. </li>
<li>Examine how the hip joints serve as a link between the distal and the proximal. </li>
<li>Integrate an FI lesson and help the student “carry” the lesson better.  </li>


<h3>Post workshop:</h3>

Included in the price of this workshop all participants will have access
to: FI videos, ATM audio recordings, and afterwards  a follow up FI
practice session (organised by Charlotte) and a ZOOM Q&amp;A (with Raz).

<strong>Face to face FI practice session: Fri 24 June at 4-7pm BST
(3 hours) </strong>

This is for those who attended the workshop and would like to get together
and do some FI practice. This will take place at the same venue. Please
contact Charlotte if you are interested.

<strong>Zoom session with Raz: Friday 8 July at 5-6pm BST (60
minutes)</strong>

Raz will also hold a Zoom live session for questions and answers to
enable participants to receive further input and guidance after having
accumulated some experience with the training content.
