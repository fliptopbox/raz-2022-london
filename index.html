        <h3>About this training:</h3>
        <p>
          In this workshop we will analyze how the hip-joints serve as the
          “launching pad” for efficient walking and upright carriage and hone
          our observational skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to recognize in the student their self-organization and gait
          patterns. The ability to observe those is essential for Functional
          Integration teachers to access the potential for long-lasting change.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will enrich our understanding by examining the functional anatomy
          of the hip joints, by analyzing videos of walking, running and
          athletic performances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day will be accompanied by an Awareness Through Movement lesson
          that is specifically chosen to highlight the functional relationships
          that will be explored in Functional Integration.
        </p>
        <p>The functionality of our hip joints is a marvel!</p>
        <p>
          On the one hand, they enable freedom in all three dimensions of
          movement. And on the other hand, they “carry” the task of supporting
          the body in non-stable conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These supposedly opposing properties, mobility and stability, are in
          fact synergistic and serve upright organization gracefully.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>Afterwards you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Recognise how the hip joints work in unison to create efficient
            support and mobility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply some functional anatomy of the hip-pelvic girdle relating to
            walking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify some functional insights from an evolutionary perspective.
          </li>
          <li>Observe and engage with your students’ gait pattern.</li>
          <li>
            Examine how the hip joints serve as a link between the distal and
            the proximal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrate an FI lesson and help the student “carry” the lesson
            better.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post workshop:</h3>

        <p>
          Included in the price of this workshop all participants will have
          access to: FI videos, ATM audio recordings, and afterwards a follow up
          FI practice session (organised by Charlotte) and a ZOOM Q&amp;A (with
          Raz).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Face to face FI practice session: </strong>
          <br />
          <em>Fri 24 June at 4-7pm BST (3 hours)</em>
          <br />
          <br />

          This is for those who attended the workshop and would like to get
          together and do some FI practice. This will take place at the same
          venue. Please contact Charlotte if you are interested.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Zoom session with Raz:</strong>
          <br />
          <em>Friday 8 July at 5-6pm BST (60 minutes)</em>
          <br />
          <br />

          Raz will also hold a Zoom live session for questions and answers to
          enable participants to receive further input and guidance after having
          accumulated some experience with the training content.
